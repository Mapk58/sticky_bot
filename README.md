# sticky_bot
Telegram bot for collecting stickers and photos for further printing.

## Getting Started

To launch and use the bot, you need to follow these steps:

### Step 1: Installing Necessary Libraries

The bot requires the Telebot and PIL libraries to work. You can install them using the following command:

```bash
pip install pyTelegramBotAPI Pillow
```

### Step 2: Bot Token Configuration

1. Create a `credentials` folder.
2. Inside the `credentials` folder, create a file named `token.txt`.
3. Save your Telegram bot token in the `token.txt` file. You can obtain a token from [BotFather](https://t.me/botfather) on Telegram.

### Step 3: Launching the Bot

To launch the bot, run the following command:

```bash
python main.py
```

Make sure you are in the project's root directory before running this command.
